# Multi_Auto_Save
initial code by Sambler -> auto_blend_save (renamed to be more explicit)

Working exactly like the Blender Auto Save but saving incremented files, without deleting older ones.
sometime you need to do a refresh to see last file when you recover it from File Menu > Recover > Auto Save
the path can be changed from blender properties or in the addon prefs

if you change save path save pref and reload blender after first save. the recover path will be the new path
