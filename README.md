# Multi_Auto_Save
initial code by Sambler -> auto_blend_save

Working exactly like the Blender Auto Save but with incremented saved files.
the save path can be changed from blender properties or in the addon prefs (they are linked)
if you change save path save pref and reload blender after first save. the recover path will be the new path
